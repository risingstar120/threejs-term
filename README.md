### Install and Running
Without Git Clonning. Otherwise look at Development section.

```
$ npm install -g threejs-term # install and link binary
$ threejs-term # runs the demo
```

### Features
- Shows off using three.js in node based environments.
- Terminal / ASCII based rendering
- Screen resize detection aka "Responsive Design"!
- Support mouse events
- Emulate keypress

### Internals
This is built with some awesome libraries.
- [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) - Duh!
- [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) - Loads of terminal goodness!
- [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) - Canvas emulation on node.js

### Development

Play with the [source](https://github.com/zz85/threejs-term/blob/master/play.js)

Install dependencies
```
$ git clone https://github.com/zz85/threejs-term.git
$ npm i # Replace npm with yarn if you like
$ npm start # or node play.js
```

It's tricky to debug blessed apps (since console.log's gonna messup the terminal),
so I'll pipe console.error messages to a log file and tail it elsewhere.
log() helper function can also be used.

```
$ npm run dev # or node play.js 2>> logs.txt
$ tail -f logs.txt
```
